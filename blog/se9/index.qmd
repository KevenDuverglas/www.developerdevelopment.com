## Overview

## Summary


## Reflection


## Action Items

In our current projects, we do a lot of code review before pushing an issue. We, on average, have 3-5 reviewers looking over an issue before it is added. We require approval from the Chief Software Architect, a Technical Leader or Professor, and a class member. The chapter states that having more than three reviewers is inefficient because some reviewers will simply skim through to see if the code runs rather than seeing if it works. If we want to fix this problem and make this process more efficient, we can have reviews done by one person who would complete the assessment on time and ensure the change is done correctly.
